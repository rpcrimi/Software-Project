The project turned out to follow the project proposal very closely. We have a separate view for logging into an account, when in the proposal, it said it would be the same as the home page. An addition to the proposal, we created a link from the professor's profile page to go to there website directly. Students and teachers have different abilities. Creating accounts as a professor as well as a student will help to see all the functionalities and views.
